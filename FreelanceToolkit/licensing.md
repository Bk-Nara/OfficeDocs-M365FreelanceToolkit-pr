Licensing requirements
=========================================

The following chart covers the licensing requirements for the toolkit: 


|                                    | Microsoft Teams (1)        | SharePoint        | Microsoft Flow        | Power BI (2) |

1. Microsoft Teams is not available as a standalone service, therefore a Microsoft 365/Office 365 Enterprise or Office 365 Business Premium subscription is required to deploy the freelance toolkit. External users can be added as a guest in Microsoft Teams, but would require a User Subscription License (USL). 
2. Power BI can be downloaded as an add-on to an existing Microsoft 365/Office 365 Enterprise or Office 365 Business Premium subscription. The free version of Power BI allows for limited functionality of the toolkit. For full functionality within the freelance toolkit, a Power BI Pro license is required.
