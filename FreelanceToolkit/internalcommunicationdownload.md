The template contains the following structures and assets:
- Welcome page

## Prerequisites
Here are current prerequisites for making this solution work in your tenant.
- You will need to be a tenant administrator to be able to deploy this solution to the target tenant. <br>
    If needed, you can get a free developer tenant from the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev-program">Office 365 developer program</a>.
- Automatic end-to-end provisioning currently works only with English language tenants. 

## Deployment steps
