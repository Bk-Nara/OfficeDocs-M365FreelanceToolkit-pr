Best practices for team-wide collaboration
==========================================

As employees start engaging with freelancers, we've found that streamlined collaboration becomes critical to operating effectively. 

The following best practices were developed based on the experience of collaborating between full time employees and cross-functional, multi-geographical freelance teams. 

Watch the experience of Beth, a training manager at Microsoft who managed a team of four full time employees and engaged a continuous flow of freelancers producing Microsoft Office training videos. Switching their operations to [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/) and [Microsoft Planner](https://products.office.com/business/task-management-software) enabled them to exceed their production goals.

Several people can review and engage on documents at the same time, <a href="https://support.office.com/article/644bf689-31a0-4977-a4fb-afe01820c1fd">pulling people in to answer questions through @mentions</a>. Engaging this way enables Beth's team to increase the pace of their work to match the pace of the freelancers they're engaged with.</p>
