Best practices for team-wide collaboration
==========================================

As employees start working with freelancers, we've found that streamlined collaboration becomes critical to operating effectively.

The following best practices were developed based on the experiences of Beth, a training manager at Microsoft, and her team of four full time employees. Beth's team works with a continuous flow freelancers producing Microsoft Office training videos, and switching their operations to [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/) and [Microsoft Planner](https://products.office.com/business/task-management-software) enabled them to exceed their production goals.

When working with freelancers, here are some best practices that have worked for us.

                        <p>Beth and her team moved their discussions to a [channel conversation in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/chat-in-microsoft-teams-f3a917cb-1a83-42b2-a097-0678298703bb). Having discussions in the open enables Beth's team to have more flexible access to information, as freelancers move in and out of projects.</p>

                        <p>Instead of passing files back and forth, Beth's team uses [co-authoring in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/9b200289-dbac-4823-85bd-628a5c7bb0ae) to actively work together on [Word](https://support.office.com/article/7dd3040c-3f30-4fdd-bab0-8586492a1f1d), [Excel](https://support.office.com/article/7152aa8b-b791-414c-a3bb-3024e46fb104), or [PowerPoint](https://support.office.com/article/0c30ee3f-8674-4f0e-97be-89cf2892a34d) files right within Teams. Several people can review and work on documents at the same time, [pulling people in to answer questions through @mentions](https://support.office.com/article/644bf689-31a0-4977-a4fb-afe01820c1fd). Working this way enables Beth's team to increase the pace of their work to match the pace of the freelancers they're working with.</p>

This way, anyone working on projects at any point has access to organized information relevant to the work.</p>

[Using Teams for meetings](https://support.office.com/article/d92432d5-dd0f-4d17-8f69-06096b6b48a8) enables them to easily sync on projects for more in-depth discussions, [capture meeting notes](https://support.office.com/article/3eadf032-0ef8-4d60-9e21-0691d317d103) and assign action items, and even [blur the background](https://support.office.com/article/f77a2381-443a-499d-825e-509a140f4780) in a video meeting, which comes in handy when they're working across time zones and need to join from home.</p>
