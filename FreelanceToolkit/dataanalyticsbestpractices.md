Best practices for data analytics
=================================

As a data-driven enterprise, we've found that measuring the effectiveness of our freelance program is critical to program growth and health.

The following best practices were developed based on the experiences of leaders across HR, Legal, Procurement, Research, Corporate Strategy, and Product Development needing to quantify program success. 

Take Chad, a Procurement director at Microsoft, and his team of sourcing managers who are focused on standing up a responsible freelance program for our enterprise. Chad's team is tasked with:

- Increasing internal demand for freelance platforms.
- Demonstrating that our freelance program enables employees to operate at an agile pace that produces quality results.
- Providing evidence that freelance projects deliver speed, scale, and efficiency aligning to our company-specific guidelines.

As Chad and his team have measured the impact of our freelance program at Microsoft, here are some best practices that have worked for them

                        <p>Chad's team invested early in identifying specific benchmarks and key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring our freelance program. Some key metrics include average time to engage, spend per project category, average spend per project, and average project duration.</p>

                        <p>While Chad's team has found that data tells a compelling story by itself, they have learned that leveraging key data points in the context of specific case studies is an effective way to share program success.</p>

                        <p>As Chad's team has been tracking the growing demand for our enterprise freelance program, they've found it useful to watch growth across the different types of tasks that employees are sending through, as well as which teams and divisions are adopting the model. This helps them understand where our freelance program is useful, and identify what other groups may benefit from additional program information.</p>

                        <p>Because freelance program adoption is varied across our enterprise, Chad's team watches spend within the program across time (total spend per month), task types, and even per employee. Understanding what projects are being funded when and where helps his team target their engagements to increase program use and effectiveness.</p>

                        <p>Chad measures the freelance program against KPIs that map to existing measurements for other proven external staffing resources, so that he can easily see whether the freelance program is realistically providing the enterprise with a responsible and scalable solution.</p>
