Best practices for data analytics
=================================

As a data-driven enterprise, we've found that measuring the effectiveness of our freelance program is critical to program growth and health.

The following best practices were developed based on the experiences of Chad, a Procurement director at Microsoft, and his team of sourcing managers who are focused on standing up a responsible freelance program for our enterprise. Chad's team is tasked with:
- Increasing internal demand for freelance platforms.
- Demonstrating that our freelance program enables employees to operate at an agile pace that produces quality results.
- Providing evidence that freelance sourcing is a responsible and scalable solution, with enough talent to supply the demands of our enterprise.


As we have measured the impact of our freelance program at Microsoft, here are some best practices that have worked for us.

                        <h3>Identify benchmarks and KPIs</h3>
                        <p>Chad's team invested early in identifying specific benchmarks and KPIs for measuring our freelance program. Some key metrics include average time to hire, spend per job category, average spend per contract, and average contract duration.</p>

                        <p>While Chad's team has found that data tells a compelling story by itself, they have learned that understanding the context behind certain data points is also important. Transformation to this new way of working is challenging in an enterprise environment, and not all progress can be quantified.</p>

                        <h3>Track demand by task type and team</h3>
                        <p>As Chad's team has been tracking the growing demand for our enterprise freelance program, they've found it useful to watch growth across the different types of tasks that employees are sending through, as well as which teams and divisions are adopting the model. This helps them understand where a freelance program is useful, and identify what other groups may benefit from additional program information.</p>

                        <h3>Measure spend across multiple pivots</h3>
                        <p>Because freelance program adoption is varied across our enterprise, Chad's team watches spend within the program across time (total spend per month), task types, and even per employee. Understanding what work is being funded when and where helps his team target their investments in understanding program effectiveness.</p>

                        <h3>Compare objectively with external staffing</h3>
                        <p>Chad measures the freelance program side-by-side with other external staffing dashboards to perform relevant analysis and comparisons. His team set up their initial freelance KPIs to map to existing measurements, so that they could easily see whether the freelance program was realistically providing our enterprise with a responsible and scalable solution.</p>
