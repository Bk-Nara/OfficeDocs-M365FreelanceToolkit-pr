Best practices for workflow automation
======================================

As our enterprise freelance program grows, we've learned that freelance program management is a high-demand, multi-faceted role.

The following best practices were developed based on the experiences of Liane, a freelance program manager at Microsoft. Liane's responsibilities span everything from facilitating onboarding, to helping people understand how and when to engage freelancers, to processing and addressing employee concerns about enterprise freelance strategy. Automating some aspects of her work has been critical to sustaining operations.

As she's automated workflows to support our freelance program at Microsoft, here are some best practices that have worked for Liane.

                        <h3>Build to scale</h3>
                        <p>Liane started small, but built her workflows in ways that would scale as the program grew. This enabled her to test the automation with low-level impact when things didn't work as planned, giving her room for fine-tuning.</p>

                        <h3>Shift repeating tasks to tools that support automation</h3>
                        <p>As Liane was figuring out how to set up our freelance program, she realized that some elements of her initial processes could be automated if she moved them to different tools. Look through the <a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/">list of Microsoft Flow connectors</a> to get a sense of what's possible.</p>

                        <h3>Think creatively</h3>
                        <p>As she stood up our enterprise freelance program, Liane found that sometimes there were tasks she couldn't automate because of elements that required human judgement. She stepped back to think about the broader systems involved and found that if she adjusted some of the ways that judgement was captured, she could reduce the cognitive load required to keep the workflow moving, and increase the pace of workflow completion.</p>

                        <h3>Workflows aren't just about data and approvals</h3>
                        <p>Liane uses automated workflows for all kinds of tasks, not just ones where captured data needs to move from one place to another, or ones where stage-gated governance is required. She automates responses to specific inquiries, distribution of announcements and newsletters, and even updates to information available on our freelance program communication site.</p>

                        <h3>Ask for help</h3>
                        <p>Liane found that if you think something can't be automated, but you're doing it repeatedly, it can probably be automated. When she recognized a repeated task and wasn't sure how to connect systems together, she captured her requirements and engaged a freelancer to propose and build a solution.</p>
