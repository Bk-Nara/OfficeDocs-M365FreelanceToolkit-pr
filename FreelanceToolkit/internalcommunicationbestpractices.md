Best practices for internal communication and awareness
=======================================================

As employees begin thinking about working with freelancers, we've found that it's important to provide access to as much information as possible, and to make onboarding clear and simple.

The following best practices were developed based on our freelance program at Microsoft, which is supported by a cross-disciplinary team that brings together stakeholders in HR, Legal, Procurement, Research, Corporate Strategy, and Product Development.

When establishing and growing our freelance program at Microsoft, here are some best practices that have worked for us.

**Provide a starting point.** We use our freelance program site as a starting point for employees, with both high-level and low-level information about our program. This helps people get the background they need to be successful in completing required training and expressing intent to comply with program requirements.

**Share your company's strategy.** On our freelance program site, we include information on the opportunities we see in this model, how other enterprises are incorporating freelance sourcing, and why our enterprise is investing in navigating this shift.

**Link to relevant research.** We've found that sharing articles and research on the gig economy has helped people understand industry trends and the work being done to continue pushing the model forward. It's been important to recognize employee concerns with this new way of working, and provide information that shows how those concerns are being addressed globally.

**Set and communicate clear rules.** Our freelance program site includes clear guidance on which types of tasks are appropriate to send to freelancers, and which are not. We share employee, manager, and Procurement responsibilities, as well as our established policies around intellectual property, confidentiality, and data protection, and we have rules around freelancer engagement, training, and platform requirements. We include answers to frequently asked questions, and continue to grow that list as we encounter new scenarios.

**Offer real-world examples.** As our employees began working with freelancers, we provided a place to share their experiences, including quality, time savings, and cost savings measures. Other employees have found it useful to browse through completed projects, categorized by task type, and see the results of the work.
