Best practices for internal communication
=========================================

As employees begin thinking about engaging with freelancers, we've found that it's important to provide access to as much information as possible, and to make onboarding clear and simple.

The following best practices were developed based on our freelance program at Microsoft, which is supported by a cross-disciplinary team that brings together stakeholders in HR, Legal, Procurement, Research, Corporate Strategy, and Product Development.

When establishing and growing our freelance program at Microsoft, here are some best practices that have worked for us.

Through a training video using <a href="https://stream.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Stream</a>, and various documentation using the <a href="https://support.office.com/article/introduction-to-libraries-7d4221d9-8fb9-40d5-8441-2374c84b5e26">SharePoint document library</a>, employees get the background they need to be successful in completing required training and expressing intent to comply with program requirements.</p>

We include answers to frequently asked questions, and continue to grow that list as we encounter new scenarios.</p>
