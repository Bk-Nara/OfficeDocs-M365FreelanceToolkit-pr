Workflow automation
===================

The end-to-end process required to operationalize and govern a freelance program requires provisioning, compliance, monitoring, all while increasing demand by providing a frictionless process for the end user.

With [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/), you can create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to get notifications, synchronize files, collect data, and more.

At Microsoft, here are some examples of how we automate our freelance program using Flow:
- Employees who complete compliance training videos automatically receive email follow-ups, and their account is automatically created on a third-party freelance platform.
- Employees who submit an application to post their first freelance project automatically receive an email follow-up once their application is accepted or denied.
- Employees who express interest in the freelance program are automatically added to a database, group, and newsletter.

Case study: Focused value
-------------------------

By automating administrative, operational, and manual tasks with Flow, our freelance program management team at Microsoft is able to focus on establishing a frictionless employee experience, which is helping us grow demand and retention.
