Tools and templates for team-wide collaboration
========================================================

The Microsoft 365 Freelance Toolkit uses your existing investments in [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) and [Microsoft Planner](https://products.office.com/business/task-management-software) to help you streamline collaboration between full time employees and cross-functional, multi-geographical freelance teams.

With Teams and Planner, enterprises can manage their freelance collaboration needs, specifically: 
- **Communication.** Public and private teams for members to engage in discussion. 
- **Task management.** One place to track project progress and align each team member's assignments.
- **File storage.** One place to store shared files and retrieve them through intelligent search.
- **Guest Access.** With [Microsoft Teams free](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/free), freelancers can join and exit your team as needed, with no cost or commitment. Employees can provide freelancers with [external guest access](https://support.office.com/article/fccb4fa6-f864-4508-bdde-256e7384a14f) to their teams, giving everyone a single place to collaborate on tasks.
