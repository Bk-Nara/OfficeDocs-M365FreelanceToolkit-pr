Tools and templates for data analytics
======================================

Start measuring business success through PowerBI  
------------------------------------------------

Capture, track, and communicate program metrics, compare freelance KPIs to contingent program options, and identify groups that leverage the program most effectively using PowerBI, a suite of business analytics tools that connect to hundreds of data sources, simplify data prep, and drive ad-hoc analysis. Along with publishing beautiful reports your organization can consume on the web and across mobile devices, PowerBI scales across the enterprise with governance and security built-in.

The Microsoft 365 Freelance Toolkit provides a custom Power BI connector to enhance core functionality for a freelance environment. This connector is designed for enterprise customers who also have an agreement with <a href="https://www.upwork.com/enterprise/">Upwork</a>. If you don't have an agreement with Upwork, Power BI offers [connector extensibility](https://github.com/Microsoft/DataConnectors) for other data sources as well.

The connector pulls data from disparate sources into dashboards, and the sample visualizations included are designed to help enterprises identify groups within your organization and their category spend where freelance is most impactful.

**[Download the connector.](downloads.md)** The freelance program Power BI connector is available as a free download through GitHub. 

Customize your freelance program Power BI dashboard
---------------------------------------------------

While the connector and sample visualizations included in this toolkit will give you a starting point, there will still be work to customize a dashboard that it reflects the specifics of your enterprise. You can [do this work yourself](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-dashboard-create), but another option is to engage a freelancer to help with customization.

For example, here's a description that you could use to engage a freelancer to help customize your freelance program Power BI dashboard:

> ### Power BI consultant/architect needed to customize a dashboard
> *Looking for an experienced individual with advanced skills in Power BI to build dashboards and data visualizations for our key KPIs: Speed, cost, quality.*
> 
> *We will provide the Excel/Azure data, which needs to be converted into a consumable format for management that will help aid business decisions. We will need assistance with logical design, physical design, implementation, testing, and deployment of the end-to-end solution. The Power BI developer should have a firm grasp of BI implementation methodologies and will have had in-depth experience with the Microsoft BI stack (SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS).*
> 
> *Specific technical skills desired include: Relational database and SQL language, analytics/OLAP cube development, report development.*

Enterprise customers who also have an agreement with [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/enterprise/) can engage with a curated **[Microsoft Power BI talent cloud](clouds.md)** for customization work.
