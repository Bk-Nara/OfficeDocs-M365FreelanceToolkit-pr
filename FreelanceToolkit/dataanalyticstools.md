Tools and templates to help with data analytics
===============================================

The Microsoft 365 Freelance Toolkit provides a custom Power BI connector to enhance Power BIâ€™s core functionality for a freelance environment.

It includes sample visualizations to help enterprises identify the groups within your organization, and the talent categories, where your freelance program is most impactful, as well as a connector to pull data from disparate sources into dashboards.

**[Download the connector.](https://placeholderfordownloadURL)** The freelance program connector is available as a free download through GitHub.

Customize your freelance program Power BI dashboard

While the connector included in this toolkit will give you a starting point, there will still be work to customize it so that it reflects the specifics of your enterprise. You can do this work yourself, but another option is to engage a freelancer to help with customization.

For example, here's a description that you could use to engage a freelancer to help customize your freelance program Power BI dashboard:

> ### Power BI consultant/architect needed to customize a dashboard
> *Looking for an experienced individual with advanced skills in Power BI to build dashboards and data visualizations for our key KPIs: Speed, cost, quality.*
> 
> *We will provide the Excel/Azure data, which needs to be converted into a consumable format for management that will help aid business decisions. We will need assistance with logical design, physical design, implementation, testing and deployment of the end-to-end solution. The Power BI developer should have a firm grasp of BI implementation methodologies and will have had in-depth experience with the Microsoft BI stack (SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS).*
> 
> *Specific technical skills desired include: Relational database and SQL language, analytics/OLAP cube development, report development.*

Enterprise customers who also have an agreement with [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/enterprise/) can engage with a curated **Power BI Expert talent cloud** for customization work.
