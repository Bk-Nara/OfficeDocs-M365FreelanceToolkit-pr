Tools and templates for workflow automation
====================================================

The Microsoft 365 Freelance Toolkit uses your existing investment in [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

Once you have defined how your enterprise freelance program will work, you can use Flow to connect systems together and automate aspects of provisioning, compliance, and monitoring.

For example, you might connect these types of workflows:
- **Account creation.** Employees who complete compliance training videos in [Microsoft Stream](https://stream.microsoft.com) receive a follow-up email with account information.
- **Newsletter sign-up.** Employees who sign up to receive a newsletter through SharePoint are added to an Excel spreadsheet.
- **Project approval communication.** Employees who submit project applications using Forms are added to a SharePoint list for review, and then receive a follow-up email when their project is approved or denied.

For Liane, a freelance program manager and full time employee at Microsoft responsible for operationalizing the freelance program, automating aspects of her work have been critical to sustaining and scaling operations. To learn how she did this and how your organization can start identifying workflow automation scenarios, refer to our best practices.

Customize workflows to automate tasks
-------------------------------------

While you can [customize workflows yourself](https://docs.microsoft.com/flow/getting-started) in Flow, another option is to engage a freelancer to help with customization.

For example, here's a description that you could use to engage a freelancer to help customize your freelance program workflows:

> ### Microsoft Flow consultant/architect needed to build enterprise workflows
> *Looking for an expert Microsoft Flow architect to build high-quality automated business process workflows that connect LOB apps with SharePoint and Outlook. Examples of workflows needed include: Whitelisting and provisioning employees, sending out notifications for task completions and next steps, and updating a Power BI dashboard with the latest data. We will need consultation and implementation services to automate the end-to-end workflow.*
> 
> *Specific technical skills desired include: Microsoft Flow, Microsoft PowerApps, and Microsoft SharePoint.*
