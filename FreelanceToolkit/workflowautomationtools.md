Tools and templates for workflow automation
====================================================

The Microsoft 365 freelance toolkit uses your existing investment in [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

Once you have defined how your enterprise freelance program will work, you can use Flow to connect systems together and automate aspects of provisioning, compliance, and monitoring.

**What is Microsoft Flow?**

What if you could automate employee onboarding? 

For Liane, a freelance program manager and full time employee at Microsoft responsible for operationalizing the freelance program, automating aspects of her work have been critical to sustaining and scaling operations. By using Microsoft Flow, she was able to automate the employee onboarding process, specifically the following scenarios: 

- **Employee training and compliance.** By visiting the freelance program [SharePoint communication site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/freelancetoolkit/internalcommunicationtools), employees can sign up for the pilot by completing a compliance training video supported by Microsoft Stream. 
- **Internal community signup.** After an employee completes the compliance training video, the employee is automatically added to an internal [Teams channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/freelancetoolkit/teamwidecollaborationtools) where employees can collaborate with others who are part of the program and share experiences.
- **Upwork account creation.** After the employee is added to the Teams channel, their account information, which includes their name and email address is sent to Upwork for account creation on their platform, so they can start posting jobs on the platform.

Customize workflows to automate tasks
-------------------------------------

While you can [customize workflows yourself](https://docs.microsoft.com/flow/getting-started) in Flow, another option is to engage a freelancer to help with customization.

For example, here's a description that you could use to engage a freelancer to help customize your freelance program workflows:

> ### Microsoft Flow consultant/architect needed to build enterprise workflows
> *Looking for an expert Microsoft Flow architect to build high-quality automated business process workflows that connect LOB apps with SharePoint and Outlook. Examples of workflows needed include: Whitelisting and provisioning employees, sending out notifications for task completions and next steps, and updating a Power BI dashboard with the latest data. We will need consultation and implementation services to automate the end-to-end workflow.*
> 
> *Specific technical skills desired include: Microsoft Flow, Microsoft PowerApps, and Microsoft SharePoint.*
