Deploy team-wide collaboration with Microsoft Teams
=========================================

Use this guide to get started with Microsoft Teams for team-wide collaboration within your organization. 

**Step 1:** Authorize external/guest access to [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/guest-access) 

For your organization to collaborate with Freelancers on Teams, they need to turn on Guest access, which is turned off by default on Teams. Depending upon your organizational group policies, you can decide how you want to handle guest access. If you decide to authorize external/guest access to Microsoft Teams, see [Guest access in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/guest-access) for information on how to turn it on.  

There are four different levels of authorization to manage Microsoft Teams Guest access features and capabilities, each of which applies to Office 365. Each authorization controls the guest experience - more information at [Authorize guest access in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-dependencies).  

**Interested in how guest access compares to federation (external access)?**

Guest access differs from external access (also known as federation) as follows: 

- With guest access, a guest user has access to a specific Teams team that the user is invited into, and can access team-specific resources such as channels and files. The guest user can also chat with and call members of the team. 
- With federation or external access, an external user can have 1:1 chats and calls with a user in another organization by using either Teams or Skype for Business. The federated user cannot access any team resources. Compared to guest access, external access allows cross organization communication (if permitted by policies) without an explicit invitation, but is limited to chat and call only. 

**Step 2:** Start inviting freelancers to your team

- [Guest capabilities in Microsoft Teams](https://support.office.com/article/d03fdf5b-1a6e-48e4-8e07-b13e1350ec7b)

**IMPORTANT:** In the current state, when a project ends, you can easily remove freelancers from Teams and they will cease to receive project and document updates.
