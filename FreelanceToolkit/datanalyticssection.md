Data analytics 
===================

A major challenge in scaling an enterprise freelance program is tracking and communicating business performance via enterprise-specific KPIs. The volume and complexity within your enterprise can make data not only hard to capture, but hard to communicate effectively.

This effects:

-   Your ability to make data-driven decisions

-   Your ability to compare freelance spend with existing external staffing options

-   Your ability to identify which freelance talent categories work best within your organization's various groups

With [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/), a suite of business analytics tools, you can collect end-to-end, real time data from every source, and customize data visualization dashboards.

------------------------------

At Microsoft, we've found that data can be a powerful adoption driver for implementing a freelance program. Comparing freelance results with external staffing options has helped us understand where freelance talent is best applied within our enterprise.
