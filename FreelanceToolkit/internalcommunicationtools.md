Customize your freelance program communication site
---------------------------------------------------

While the template included in this toolkit will give you a starting point, there will still be work to customize it so that it reflects the specifics of your enterprise. You can do this work yourself, but another option is to engage a freelancer to help with this work.

For example, here's a description that you could use to engage a freelancer to help customize your freelance program communication site:
