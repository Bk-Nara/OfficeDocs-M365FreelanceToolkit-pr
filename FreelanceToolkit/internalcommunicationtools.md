Tools and templates for internal communication
==============================================

The Microsoft 365 Freelance Toolkit provides a specialized SharePoint communication site template to help enterprises create a one-stop shop for their freelance program details, with tools to help accelerate onboarding and adoption.

It includes:
- A library for relevant documentation and presentations about the program.
- An FAQ seeded with top questions from enterprise employees.
- Spaces for research, strategy, case studies, videos, events, and more.



**[Download the template.](downloads.md)** The freelance program SharePoint communication site template is available as a free download through GitHub.

Customize your freelance program communication site
---------------------------------------------------

While the template included in this toolkit will give you a starting point, there will still be work to customize it so that it reflects the specifics of your enterprise. You can [do this work yourself](https://support.office.com/article/320b43e5-b047-4fda-8381-f61e8ac7f59b), but another option is to engage a freelancer to help with customization.

For example, here's a description that you could use to engage a freelancer to help customize your freelance program communication site:

> ### SharePoint consultant/architect needed to customize a communication site
> *Looking for a SharePoint Online consultant/architect to set up a portal site that hosts employee communications, documents, and calendar events. Site should be built so that we can leverage features, workflows, checklists, and approvals to enable automation.*

Enterprise customers who also have an agreement with [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/enterprise/) can engage with a curated **[Microsoft SharePoint talent cloud](clouds.md)** for customization work.
